_a personal notebook of sorts to document the progress of the agent programs_

* **remote-inspection**: simply converting the remote inspection bit into an EASS program
* **remote-inspection-random_location**: same thing 
* **pw_attempt_maintain**: a first attempt at the plan weakening agent in the EASS 
* **pw_attempt_maintain_reasoning_in_abstraction**: not really what the name says, there is no reasoning in the abstraction engine (AE) yet but when radiation levels are not low, the AE stops the agent from moving 
* **pw_attempt_maintain_reasoning_in_abstraction_avoid**: so this _will_ have the reasoning in the AE - simply check if the location we are _near_ is in our locations of interest belief, if so stop the agent, do all the required reasoning, and continue the plan or replan
